# Locale specific settings
It's possible to set the locale so that weekday column names are automatically set by the calendar.
```java
        CompactCalendarView compactCalendarView = (CompactCalendarView) findViewById(R.id.compactcalendar_view);
        compactCalendarView.drawSmallIndicatorForEvents(true);
        compactCalendarView.setLocale(Locale.CHINESE);
        compactCalendarView.setUseThreeLetterAbbreviation(true);
```

# Example usage
It is possible to change the apreance of the view via a few properties. This includes the background color, text color, textsize color of the current day and the color of the first day of the month.

```xml
    <com.github.sundeepk.compactcalendarview.CompactCalendarView
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/compactcalendar_view"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:paddingRight="10dp"
        android:paddingLeft="10dp"
        android:layout_height="250dp"
        app:compactCalendarTextSize="12sp"
        app:compactCalendarBackgroundColor="#ffe95451"
        app:compactCalendarTextColor="#fff"
        app:compactCalendarFirstDayOfMonthBackgroundColor="#E57373"
        app:compactCalendarCurrentDayBackgroundColor="#B71C1C"
        />
```
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.sundeepk:compact-calendar-view:1.7.3'
}

```

Please let me know if you are using this in your app so that I can add you as a list of users in the readme :).

TODO:
* Make drawing calendar more efficient by drawing all in one loop (currently requires 3).
* Make drawing circles on current/first day based on width/height for each cell and remove any magic numbers there.
* Benchmark code and add results on readme.
